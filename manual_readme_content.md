Recorded Future App for Phantom allows clients to work smarter, respond faster, and strengthen their
defenses through automation and orchestration. The Recorded Future App provides a number of actions
that enable the creation of Playbooks to do automated enrichment, correlation, threat hunting, and
alert handling.

# Ingest alerts into events

With alerting rules set up in your Recorded Future enterprise, triggered alerts can now be ingested
in Splunk SOAR as events.The ingestion configuration is set per asset under the tabs "Asset
Settings" and "Ingest Settings".

"Asset Settings" defines a list of rule IDs, what severity to apply to the new events and set the
limits for the number of events created by the ingestion.
