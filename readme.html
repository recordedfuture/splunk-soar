    <p>Recorded Future App for Phantom allows clients to work smarter,
      respond faster, and strengthen their defenses through automation and
      orchestration. The Recorded Future App provides a number of actions that
      enable the creation of Playbooks to do automated enrichment,
      correlation, threat hunting, and alert handling.
    </p>
    <h2>Recorded Future Demo Playbooks</h2>
    <p>Together with the Recorded Future App for Phantom 3.0, a new demo
      playbook was created and uploaded to the community site. The new playbook
      incorporates the new assessment functionality.
    </p>
    <p>Four demo playbooks were released with the Recorded Future App
      for Phantom 2.0 to show how the actions in the app can be used.
      The playbooks are designed to operate on a Recorded Future App asset
      named "recorded-future" and Phantom SMTP asset named "smtp". If the
      assets are named differently, the playbooks will be adjusted. The email
      address used for the alert emails is specified in the linked SMTP asset.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Correlation Playbook</strong><br/>
      This playbook shows how to obtain IP reputation and, if its risk score is
      90 or more, add the IP address to a bad IP address list maintained by
      Phantom plus forward the information to Splunk and in an email.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Enrichment Playbook</strong><br/>
      This playbook shows how to obtain intelligence of an IP address and, if
      its risk score is 90 or more, to forward this in an email as well as
      adding the IP to a bad IP address list maintained by Phantom.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Threat Hunting Playbook</strong><br/>
      The purpose of this playbook is to find out the IP reputation and when its
      risk score is 90 or above, to find related entities - IP addresses,
      domains, files, vulnerabilities, and/or URLs - and to search for them in
      Splunk. The results are summarised in an email and the IP address is added
      to the bad IP address list maintained by Phantom.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Handling of Leaked Credentials</strong><br/>
      The purpose of this
      playbook is to demonstrate how Recorded Future Alerts can be used to
      monitor various threats such as leaked credentials. The playbook is
      designed to be scheduled, polling for new alerts each time it is run. If
      an alert is found the information is forwarded via an email.
