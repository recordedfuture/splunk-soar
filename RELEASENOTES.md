# RELEASE NOTES

## VERSION 4.0

This version adds on_poll functionality to the Recorded Future integration app for 
Splunk (SOAR) to enable download and processing of Recorded Future alerts. 

There are two new actions: alert lookup and alert update. 

Two actions have changed name to better describe their functionality: 
1. from alert rule lookup to alert rule search
2. alert data lookup to alert search

The Recored Future alert structure has been cleaned up to provide better visibility 
of the information included. 

Entities within the alerts have been marked up by type so that the relevant data is 
easier to find when writing playbooks. 


## VERSION 3.1

Recorded Future Links have been added to the intelligence lookups. These are entities
that have been verified to be linked together by research or technical analysis, unlike
the related entities which have been associated with each other solely because they
have been found in the same document(s). 

The linked entities have been marked up by type and can be used without further 
modification for downstream actions in a playbook.

There are a few other improvements, such as better feedback for testing of 
connectivity, fetching of alerts, etc.


## VERSION 3.0

This version uses Recorded Future's new extension of the SOAR API which is
designed to do automatic threat assessments for sets of related IOCs (ex all IOCs 
collected from an email) in a given context (ex Phishing).

All dashboards have been improved for better readability.

## VERSION 2.0

This version uses Recorded Future's new SOAR API when performing the reputation
actions. This API is designed for much higher volume of calls.

A new configuration option has been added to disable SSL certificate verification.
This is sometimes needed when access to Internet is through a proxy.

### Upgrading

In most cases no manual action is required.

## VERSION 1.2

This version is a complete re-write of the app. It is not backwards compatible
with previous versions.

### Upgrading

When upgrading from a previous version of the app it will be necessary to do
the following steps for each playbook that uses the app:

1. Verify that the asset configuration is still valid.
1. Determine if it is still possible to use "ip reputation", "file reputation",
   or "domain reputation" or if it necessary to switch to the corresponding
   "intelligence" action. To switch or not depends on what results are
   used.
1. Adapt any component that uses data from an action in the app. Most JSON
   paths have changed.

### Changed Actions

1. **ip reputation**: the action returns a smaller set of information 
   compared to previous versions. The new action "ip intelligence" returns
   a similar set of information as the previous version, the format is
   changed however.
1. **domain reputation**: the action returns a smaller set of information 
   compared to previous versions. The new action "domain intelligence" returns
   a similar set of information as the previous version, the format is
   changed however.
1. **file reputation**: the action returns a smaller set of information 
   compared to previous versions. The new action "file intelligence" returns
   a similar set of information as the previous version, the format is
   changed however.
1. **lookup vulnerability**: the action as been renamed to 
   **vulnerability reputation**. It returns a smaller set of information 
   compared to previous versions. The new action "vulnerability intelligence" 
   returns a similar set of information as the previous version, the format is
   changed however.


### New Actions

1. **ip intelligence**: get an extensive context for the given IP number. 
   Full Risk information, Related Entities, Metrics, Threat Lists and 
   Timestamps are provided.
1. **domain intelligence**: get an extensive context for the given domain.
   Full Risk information, Related Entities, Metrics, Threat Lists and 
   Timestamps are provided.
1. **file intelligence**: get an extensive context for the given file hash.
   Full Risk information, Related Entities, Metrics, Threat Lists, Hash
   Algorithm and Timestamps are provided.
1. **vulnerability intelligence**: get an extensive context for the given
   vulnerability (ex CVE id).
   Full Risk information, Related Entities, Metrics, Threat Lists, CVSS 
   data, NVD Description and Timestamps are provided.
1. **url intelligence**: get an extensive context for the given url.
   Full Risk information, Related Entities, Metrics and Timestamps is 
   provided.
1. **url reputation**: get reputation information for an URL.
1. **alert rule lookup**: search for Alert Rule Ids by Rule Name.
1. **alert data lookup**: fetch all information about Recorded Future Alerts 
   triggered for an Alert Rule Id and a time range.
